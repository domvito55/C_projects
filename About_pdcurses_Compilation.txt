GCC instalation
Download and Install MSYS2:
	Download the installer from msys2.org.
	Run the installer and follow the instructions.
	Open the MSYS2 shell from the Start Menu.

pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc



gcc CobrinhaMatriz.c -I D:/pCloudFolder/Repositories/LongLiveRepos/C_projects/PDCurses-3.8 D:/pCloudFolder/Repositories/LongLiveRepos/C_projects/PDCurses-3.8/wincon/pdcurses.a -o main.exe


To add 3rd party libraries to a C project compilation

gcc main.c -I foo/include foo/lib/foo.a -o main.exe


the -I flag adds to the path searched for headers.
You can also add to the lib path, but then things start to get complicated :-)


I could not make this approach to work

gcc -I/mingw64/include/ncurses -o PROGRAMNAME main.c -lncurses -L/mingw64/bin -static
